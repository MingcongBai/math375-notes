Linear Spaces
-------------

Definition: Let `V` be a non-empty set of elements (or vectors), `V` is then called a linear space if it satisfies the following axions.

Example: `V = { ƒ: ℝ → ℝ, ƒ(1) = 0 }`, f as in functions.

- Polynomials with sum of coefficient equal to zero.
- `ln(x)`, where when `x = 1`, `ƒ(x) = 0`.

(Therefore this `V` is not an empty set, as supplied with the two examples above)

### Axioms

#### Closure axioms:

- Closure under addition: For all `x`, `y` in `V`, there exists a unique `x + y` belonging to `V`, called a sum of `x` and `y`. [1]
- Closure under multiplication: For any `x` in `V`, and any real number `a`, there exists an unique product of `a` and `x`; or denoted as `ax`. [2]

Examples:

- `(ƒ+g)(1) = ƒ(1) + g(1) = 0 + 0 = 0`, where `ƒ+g` belongs in `V`. [1]
- `(aƒ)(1) = a · ƒ(1) = a · 0 = 0`, where af belongs to `V`. [2]

*General examples to an axiom, generally relates to real life.*

#### Axioms for addition:

- Communicative Law: `x + y = y + x` for a `x` and `y` in `V`. [3]
- Associative Law: `( x + y ) + z= x + (y + z)` for all `x`, `y`, `z` in `V`. [4]

Example:

- `(ƒ + g)(1) = ƒ(1) + g(1) = g(1) + ƒ(1) = (g+ƒ)(1)`, where f+g belongs to V. [3], [4]

#### Existence of zero Element:

There is an element in `V`, denoted by `O`, such that: `x + O = x` for all `x` in V. [5]

Example:

`(ƒ + O)(x) = ƒ(1) + (O)(1) = 0 + 0 = 0`, where all `x` are real numbers. [5]

#### Existence of negatives:

For any `x` in `V`, there exists an `(-x)` belongs in V, so that `x + (-1)(x) = 0`.

Example:

`(-ƒ)(1) = -ƒ(1) = 0`, where given `ƒ(1) = 0`. [6]

#### Axioms for multiplication:

- Associative Law: for all x in V, and for all real numbers a, b, `a(bx) = (ab)x`. [7]
- Distributive Law for Addition in V: for all x, y in V, and for all real number a, `a(x+y) = ax + ay`. [8]
- Distributive Law for Addition of Numbers: for all x in V, and for all real numbers a, b, `(a + b)x = ax + bx`. [9]

#### Existence of identity:

For all x in V, `1x = x`. [10]

A Taste of Proving (in t-order)
-------------------------------

To prove that "zero" element is unique in any linear space (one and only one). *A big claim*

To justify a claim - proving.

```
Proof:

  Suppose that O_1 and O_2 are elements of V. To show O_1 = O_2.

  Add O_1 and O_2, O_1 + O_2. According to Axiom [5] where:

  x + O = x, thus O_1 + O_2 = O_1 - as both O_1 and O_2 are zero elements,
  complying to [5].

  Applying with [1], O_2 + O_1 = O_1 + O_2 = O_1. Therefore O_1 = O_2, proving
  that there's one and only one zero element in a linear space.
```
