Why do we need to learn linear space?
-------------------------------------

Human are not designed to process non-linear functions (part of the space I suppose), and we do non-linear computation via a linear way (calculus and the idea of extreme/singularity). Neither could a computer do this natively.

Linear space is the base and at the same time, foundation of mathematics.

Ten Axioms for Linear Space
---------------------------

A set of elements/functions with two simple operations:

- Addition (not necessarily a "normal" addition, may be defined differently depending by need of a question; in another word, not necessarily "summation").
- Multiplication (same as addition, multiplication may be defined differently, say, as "power to").

Operations are defined.

An example of a Linear Space
----------------------------

Some more notations of mathematical logic.

| Symbol        | Meaning          |
|---------------| -----------------|
| S.t or &#124; | "Such that"      |
| :=            | "Is defined by"  |

Let `V:={ (x, y, z) ∈ ℝ^3 | x + y + z = 0 }`, where `+` is defined as normal summation, `ℝ` is normal multiplication product.

Therefore, operations on this element can be presented as follows:

```
(x, y, z) + (v, w, s) = (x + v, y + w, z + s)
a · (x, y, z) = (a · x, a · y, a · z)
```

#### What is a zero element in Linear Space?

The zero vector.

#### Question: is (V,"+",R) linear space?

To answer the question, one must prove:

- To prove the standing - prove all 10 Axioms.
- Or to counter-prove - disprove one of 10 Axioms.

#### Proof [1]

Two elements (arbitrary) in `V`, `(x1, y1, z1)`,`(x2, y2, z2)` in `V`. The proof is to show that addition of all pairs of elements belong in  `V` .

Must show that

`(x1, y1, z1) + (x2, y2, z2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2, z1 + z2)`

By definition of operation (normal summation) - belongs in `V`.

We would set `a`, `b`, `c` such that `(a, b, c)` belongs in `V`. Where by definition, a summation of 3 coordinates must equal zero, therefore `a + b + c = 0` (show `(a, b, c)` belongs in `V`). Where:

- `a = x1 + x2`
- `b = y1 + y2`
- `c = z1 + z2`

Since

```
a + b + c  = x1 + x2 + y1 + y2 + z1 + z2
          = x1 + y1 + z1 + x2 + y2 + z2
          = 0 + 0
          = 0
```

Therefore, `(a, b, c)` belongs in `V`, and all elements, namely, `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` belongs in `V`.

*[1] holds true.*

#### Proof [2]

An arbitrary element `(x, y, z)` belongs in `V`, and `a` is a real rumber.

Must show `a · (x, y, z) = (a · x, a · y, a · z)` belongs in `V` - summation of all coordinates is still zero.

Since

```
a · x + a · y + a · z = a · (x + y + z)
                    = 0
```

Therefore `(ax, ay, az)` belongs in `V`.

*[2] holds true.*

#### Implications of [1] and [2]

With [1], [2] proven, the following axioms may be proven respectively.

Another example
---------------

`V := { y = ƒ(x) | y" + y' = 0 }`, operations of functions are by normal definition:

Therefore:

- `(ƒ + g)(x) = ƒ(x) + g(x)`
- `(aƒ)(x) = a · ƒ(x)`

#### Question: Show (V,"+",R) is linear space, show only Axioms [1] and [2].

(Normally show all Axioms hold, due to time limitation, only showing [1] and [2])

Key: replace y with an arbitrary function for collection.

`[(d^2y/dx^2 ƒ(x) + g(x)] + dy/dx[ƒ(x) + g(x)]`.
