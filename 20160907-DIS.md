Why do we need to learn linear space?
-------------------------------------

Human are not designed to process non-linear functions (part of the space I suppose), and we do non-linear computation via a linear way (calculus and the idea of extreme/singularity). Neither could a computer do this natively.

Linear space is the base and at the same time, foundation of mathematics.

Ten Axioms for Linear Space
---------------------------

A set of elements/functions with two simple operations:

- Addition (not necessarily a "normal" addition, may be defined differently depending by need of a question; in another word, not necessarily "summation").
- Multiplication (same as addition, multiplication may be defined differently, say, as "power to").

Operations are defined.

An example of a Linear Space
----------------------------

Some more notations of mathematical logic.

- `S.t` - "Such that".
- `:=` - "Is defined by".
- `|` - "Such that".

`V:={ (x,y,z) E R^3 | x+y+z = 0 }`, where + is defined as normal summation, R is normal multiplication product.

(x,y,z)+(v,w,s)=(x+v,y+w,z+s)
a(x,y,z)=(ax,ay,az)

#### What is a zero element in Linear Space?

The zero vector.

#### Question: is (V,"+",R) linear space?

To answer the question, one must prove:

- To prove the standing - prove all 10 axioms.
- Or to counter-prove - disprove one of 10 axioms.

#### Proof [1]

Two elements (arbitrary) in V, (x1,y1,z1),(x2,y2,z2) in V. The proof is to show that addition of all pairs of elements belong in V.

Must show (x1,y1,z1)+(x2,y2,z2)=(x1+x2,y1+y2,z1+z2) by definition of operation (normal summation) - belongs in V.

We would set a, b, c such that (a,b,c) belongs in V. Where summation of 3 coordinates equals zero, therefore a+b+c=0 (show (a,b,c) belongs in V). Where:

- a = x1+x2
- b = y1+y2
- c = z1+z2

Therefore and since,

a+b+c=x1+x2+y1+y2+z1+z2=x1+y1+z1+x2+y2+z2=0+0=0

Therefore, (a,b,c) belongs in V, and all elements, namely, (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) belongs in V.

[1] holds true.

#### Proof [2]

Element (x,y,z) (arbitrary) belongs in V, and a is a real rumber.

Must show a(x,y,z)=(ax,ay,az) belongs in V - summation of all coordinates is still zero.

Since ax+ay+az=a(x+y+z)=0,

Therefore (ax,ay,az) belongs in V.

[2] holds true.

#### Implications of [1] and [2]

With [1], [2] proven, the following axioms may be proven respectively.

Another example
---------------

V:={ y=f(x) | y"+y'=0 }, operations of functions are by normal definition:

- (f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x).
- (af)(x)=af(x).

#### Question: Show (V,"+",R) is linear space, show only Axioms [1] and [2].

(Normally show all Axioms hold, due to time limitation, only showing [1] and [2])

Key: replace y with an arbitrary function for collection (d2y/dx2(f(x)+g(x))+dy/dx(f(x)+g(x)).
