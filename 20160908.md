Linear Spaces
-------------

Also known as "Vector Spaces".

A collection of elements and vector scalars of `V`, which can be `(V, +, ·ℝ)` in all operations. Which represents as...

`ℝ` are scalars (can also use complex scalars).

Therefore, linear space applies to real numbers, elements, real scalars, and complex numbers/scalars.

Examples of linear spaces
-------------------------

- `(ℝ, +, ·)` for all real numbers.
- `(C, +, ·ℝ)` for all complex numbers.
- `(ℝ^n) = { (x1, x2, ..., xn) ∈ ℝ}`.

·ℝ multiplications by scalars.

Too add two vector elements...

`(x1, x2, ..., xn) + (y1, y2, ..., yn) = (x1 + y1, x2 + y2, ..., xn + yn)`

- `V = { ƒ: I -> ℝ }` Interval in `ℝ`. `(ƒ + g)(x) = ƒ(x) + g(x)`, same goes for multiplications: `(aƒ)(x) = a · ƒ(x)`.
- `V = { Polynomials with real coefficients }`, `+`, `·ℝ`.
- `Vn = { Polynomials of degree ≤ n }`, `+`, `·ℝ`.

Warning:
`{ Polynomials of degreee n }` do not form a linear space.

`(x + 1) + (-x + 1) ≠ 0`

- `C(a, b) = { ƒ[a, b] -> ℝ, continuous }`.
- `V` = all differentiable functions (at a given point).
- `V = { integrable functions on a given interval }`.
- `V = { solutions y(x) of y" + ay' + by = 0 }`.

Consequences of the Axioms
--------------------------

#### Theorem 1. The uniqueness of the zero element

`x + 0 = x` for all `x` in linear space.

#### Theorem 2. The uniqueness of negative elements

For all `x` in linear space, there is only one `y` in linear space such that `x + y = 0`.

Proof. [6] there exists a `y = (-1)x`, such that `x + y = 0`.

Assume that there are `y1`, `y2` in `V` so that `x + y1 = 0`, and `x + y2 = 0`.

Show `y1 = y2`: add `y2` to both sides of `x + y1 = 0`.

`y2 + (x + y1) = y2` => `(y2 + x) + y1 = 0 + y1`

Therefore `y2 + x = 0`, and with given `y1 = y1`. In which case `y2 = y2`. There is only one negative for a given number in linear space.

*This unique negative of `x` in `V` is denoted as `-x`.*

Define: `y - x = y + (-x)`.

#### Theorem 3. x,y E V, a,b E ℝ, there are the following properties.

- `0r · x = Ov` [a]
- `a · Ov = Ov` [b]
- `(-a)x = -(ax) = a(-x)`: signs may be moved with no impact on product [c]
- If `ax = Ov`, then either `a = 0r` or `x = Ov` [d]
- If `ax = ay`, and `a ≠ 0r`, then `x = y` [e]
- If `ax = bx`, and `x ≠ Ov`, then `a = b` [f]
- `-(x + y) = (-x) + (-y) = -x - y` [g]
- `x + x = 2x`, `x + x + x = 3x`, and in general summation of `Sig(i = 1, n)x = nx` (or `x + x + x + ... + x = nx`) [h]

##### Proof [a]

Let `z = 0r · x`.

`z + z = 0r · x + 0r · x`, by Axiom [9], `(0r + 0r) · x = 0r · x = z`.

Add `-z`: `z + z - z = z - z = z + (z - z) = z - z`, therefore `z + 0v = z`.

Threfore proving [a].

##### Proof [b]

Practice example.

##### Proof [c]

Let `z = (-a)x`. `z + ax = (-a)x + ax => (Axiom [9]) => (-a + a)x = 0r · x`,

In conjunction with [a], `Or = Ov`.

Therefore `z = -(ax)`.

`a(-x) + ax => (Axiom [8]) => a(-x + x) = aOv => [b] => Ov`, therefore `a(-x) = -ax`.

##### Proof [d]

Practice example.

Subspaces of a linear space
---------------------------

Given a linear space `V`, let `S` be a non-empty subset of `V`. If `S` is also a linear space, with the same operations of addition and multiplication of scalars, then `S` is called a subspace of `V`.

- `⊂` subset of.
- `⊃` superset of.
- `⊆` subset and equal to.

`S` is a subspace of `V`, iff (`<==>`, hold bi-directional) `S` satisfies the closure Axioms ([1], [2]). Only [1] and [2] are necessary to be proven for all rest to be proven.

- `=>` If `S` is a subspace of `V`, it satisfies all 10 Axioms, hence also the closure Axioms.
- `<=` Assume `S` satisfies Axiom [1], [2]. Show `S` satisfies the remainder of all Axioms.
